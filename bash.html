		 	Hello Khang,
		 	<br>
		 	I hope this letter finds you well. There are a few things I've been wanting to say to you, and I hope you'll take them to
			 <span class="word"> your heart </span> and btw I spent all day writing this so its a little bit longer than I thought and 
			 turn your volumn down a bit...
			 <span class="word"></span> 
			 <span class="word"></span>
			 <span class="word"></span>.
		 	<br>
		 	I dont even know if this is a love letter for you or just a letter of my thought .
			Even though we're no longer talking together as usual,
			I want you to know you are still <span class="word">mean the world to me,
			</span> and I find myself thinking about you all the time 
			which hurt so bad because of the crave of caring that I 
			want from you.<span class="word"> </span>
			<span class="word"> </span> 
		 	<br>
		 	Watching you grow and improve and be free in the way that 
			you want has been one of the greatest joys of my life, your strength, 
			your kindness, and your unwavering determination continue to inspire me every day. There are things that im too shy 
			to tell you, dont you know that i want your attention all the time, I overthink a lot 
			, I love it when ur clingy to me, I love it when you annoy me, I feel guilty that I make you mad 
			and take away your freedom, Sorry for that bae, I love talking to you even if I'm busy, I get jealous when you pay 
			more attention to someone else, I appreciate you a lot...my wish? please take 
			me back to the month when us were obsessed with eachother and all we want were eachother as well...
			I asked myself, why I went from strong independent to such a weak, vulnerable, a feminine...Because 
			you was on the right path for making me feel safe enough to set free my innerchild. I broke 
			every rule just for you. My mind told me that I should give you space, I shouldnt bother you...But my heart? 
			Is he okay? Is he happy? Is he even thinking about me...I just hope my absence brought you peace in mind.
			You're truly one of a kind, Khang. I miss you but I miss us more...I'm so so so love you Khang, I love your appearance, your 
			voice, the way that you make me laugh at that night, the night that when I looked into your eyes, 
			those brown eyes was a man who just wanted to be treated well, who just wanted to be loved...and sometimes, i know that I 
			couldnt love you right because I dont even know how to love myself...
			<span class="word"></span>
		 	<br>
		 	I know things didn't work out between us right now since 
			you and I are having a break, I no longer in VietNam and 
			you want to have some personal space, 
			but I want you to know that I'll always 
			cherish the memories we shared. You brought 
			so much <span class="word">love and happiness </span>
			into my life, and I'm always be grateful for that. I learned from you 
			that I can be happy with or without my lover, although I crave a 
			lot of attention especially from such an important person like you. I realize that I 
			have to be tough again because the more I get comfortable, the more vulnerable 
			I will be (*sad face*), I know you and I just want us to be like other 
			couples out there, some are also in LDR, its hard but they still figure out 
			how to be happy together which is the exact thing I want 
			to do with you...I truly want...The "Read When Need" Book, plushie, shirts, 
			kisses sweater, I really want to give you more than those, you must hear this for a thousand
			 time but right now haha but Im crying when writing this again, and you 
			 know what? I cry every nights because I miss you so much. The cares and word of loves...
			Sometimes I do think that I deserved more than this, but I cant 
			stop me from loving you, you may fell in love with me at first, but i fell for you harder... 
			I pray to god every night, please, us will be fine, please let him be happy, please let him be success, 
			please give him the best life ever...I might not be perfect but I know that no girl can love you 
			this much than me... If I got the world, ill give you the world, part of me is you and always be you baby.
			I hope you like my gift, I know you always need 
			a new keyboard to do your stuff, hopefully this will help you to do a lot of things in the future, help 
			you get money.  
		 	<br>
		 	I hope you're doing well, Khang, 
			and that life is treating you kindly you are yourself now. 
			Just remember that no matter where life takes us, 
			you'll always have a special place in my heart and the greatest boyfriend ever. 
			With or without me, I hope you live the life that you want and be
			yourself. If I pushed you too hard in love, please tell me...Once again, id rather hurt, than let you be hurted by
			 the way that i love you...Whatever it is you want, ill accept it and I promise you I wont mad, sad or hate you Khang 
			 Im too love you for it, and always love you. 
			<span class="word"> </span>

		 	Best Wishes for you, em yeu anh.
