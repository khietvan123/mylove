# Love-Letters :heart:

This is a project that includes love letters for Bash, Git, and Github. The webpages are handcoded with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. This project is to help others gauge my design abilities and my skills in HTML, CSS, and creative Javascript. There is no future plans for this project.  And the source code is free online, a letter for my lover to express my feeling for him on valentine 2024.
